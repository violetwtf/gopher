# Gopher!
General-purpose Discord bot built in Go.

## Development Disclaimer
Gopher! is a working title. I don't know if I'll change it or not. Also, this is in development and has not been actively released. This README will update to reflect relase when the time comes.  

This software is also in development, and so will not be supported.

## Building & Installation
Gopher! does not support building or instsalling its software. We will not provide support for this. Do not create issues about it.

Self-Hosting Agreement:  
If you do manage to build Gopher! and host it yourself, you agree to the following:
* You will not use the active or former branding of Gopher!
* You will make your bot distinguishable from Gopher!
* You will leave all mentions to Gopher! and its repository in the `about` command.
  * Note: If you fork Gopher!, you may also mention your repository, however, you must leave mentions to Gopher!, the original repository, and the underlying software in place.

## Contributing
Just like with building/installation, if you manage to get it to work, congratulations. If you decide to make pull requests, name it in this format:
```
[github username]-[feature/patch]-[related issue number]
```
All pull requests must have a corresponding issue.  
Your PR is a feature if: **Functionality of the program changes to add to its current state.**  
Your PR is a patch if: **Functionality of the program changes to fix an issue or edit the code to reflect intended behavior.**

An example of this format would be:
```
violetwtf-feature-12
```
This means that violetwtf wrote a feature that covers issue 12.

**The active maintainer of this repository (violetwtf) will not include the username section in their branches. This is the _only_ exception to this rule.**
